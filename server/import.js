      'As their name implies, the Short Reach handlebars are designed for those that require a shorter reach in order to obtain the optimal bike fit. Along these lines, they feature a 65mm reach (which is about 10 to 15mm shorter than "average") and a shallow 125mm drop. This also comes with the added benefit of increased control at the hoods and levers. And for the construction, we selected a lightweight, yet highly durable, 6061 Premium Butted Aluminum that\'s sure to stand up to years of hard riding. 6062 premium butted aluminum, high-strength design. Short reach for optimal brake/shift control. Shallow Bend Drop: 125mm drop x 65mm reach',
